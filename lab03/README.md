* isDescSorted - that checks if list is sorted descending.
* foldLeft - that applies binary operator to start value and all of list elements from left to right.
* sum - that sums all of list elements.
* length - that calculates list length.
* compose - that composes two unary functions.
* repeated - that composes given function n times.
* curry - that converts function of two arguments into function of one argument that partially applies f.
* uncurry - that reverts curry function.
