# lab 01

During this lab, we were required to write the following functions:
* scalar - calculates the scalar product of two vectors, xs and ys.
* sort - implements the quicksort algorithm.
* isPrime - checks whether a number n is prime.

Functions with "Ugly" in their names were allowed to use vars, do-while loops, and other imperative constructs. Other functions were expected to use vals and for comprehensions for a more functional approach.
